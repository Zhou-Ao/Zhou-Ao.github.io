<p>Finally, I am writing in my own blog. During past couple of days, a newbie, I, who  only knew little about the World Wide Web, started to create interesting things based on the web out of curiosity. The feeling of building things is cool, especially something meaningful. I hope from now on, I can learn to become a hacker, devoting myself to solving problems with powerful computational tools, and make the world little bit prettier.</p>

<p>###1. Financial Assistance Database System for Living Sanctuary Brethren Church###
The Financial Assistance Database System (FADS) is a <strong>database management software</strong> for the course <strong>BC2402 Database Management &amp; Business Intelligence</strong>. In fact, I did not take this course, while my girlfriend did. Although she majors in computer science and business, programming never eased her. In urgent request of my girlfriend to help her with the project, I had to survive myself from server-side programming, client-side programming and SQL with my not so sufficient knowledge of C/C++ and Matlab.</p>

<p>For <strong>only one week</strong>, I learned <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>. Isn’t it amazing? What really drove me crazy was to install <strong>Apache/PHP/MySQL</strong> on my own laptop with Windows 8.1. Without a installation wizard, there were huge works to do with the configuration files with considerable variables inside and to type every command in CMD. Here, I would like to share some useful sites which I used for the FADS project.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/index.html"><strong>Programming Notes</strong></a> This a substantial note written by Associate Professor <a href="http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=EHCHUA"><strong>Chua Hock Chuan</strong></a>, including How-To, Java	, SQL, Server-Side, Client-Side, JavaME, Game, OpenGL, C++ and Android. It is a rarely brief but excellent note for new programmers.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><strong>W3Schools</strong></a> Perhaps, this is the world’ largest web development site. There are professional tutorials and references for HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Server Side, XML and Web Building with plenty of vivid instant examples. You can find everything you need to build a website.</li>
  <li><strong>Apache/PHP/MySQL</strong> For the installation, I searched oceans of documentations, articles, blogs and posts, but failed to find one page that could give step-by-step instructions from the beginning to end. I am able to make it only with references from different source. Maybe when I become a real master one day, I will write a blog about the installation.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the joint effort with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chenggibson"><strong>Gibson Cheong</strong></a>, <strong>we used HTML and CSS to build the front-end interface, and as for the back-end, we used PHP and MySQL</strong>. The FADS is a <strong>muti-user</strong> management system. There are three types of users: super user, administrator and system user, and two kinds of operations, user related operation and financial application (FA) related operation. User related operations include create user, view user, edit user, delete user. Financial application related operation include create FA, search FA, view FA, edit FA, delete FA, generate report, issue disbursement. Different users with different user types have corresponding authorities. Super users have authority to do all the operations. Administrators have authority to do all the financial application related operations. And system users only have authority to create FA and view FA. As for implementation, I did the part of <strong>user management</strong> and <strong>interface design</strong>, and Gibson did part of the financial management and compilation.</p>

<p>Actually, this is my first time to get involved such a project. To be honest, I was quite enjoying it. There is no doubt I gained practical skills throng the project.</p>

<h3 id="registration-of-my-own-domain">2. Registration of My Own Domain</h3>
<p>After the last Financial Assistance Database System Project and knowing how to create web page using HTML and CSS, I could not wait to publish something real on the Internet. By researching, I realized that to do this, I had to do the following two steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Register a domain</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Find a host service provider</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Setup the web host and upload web pages</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the domain, I desired to register a top level domain related my name, Zhou Ao, but I did not expect to spend on any money on it (How poor a undergraduate student is). So I chose to register a <strong>.tk</strong> domian in <a href="http://www.freenom.com/"><strong>Freenom</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The free web host may never be a good choice, only if you just want to try publish something unimportant. For a real site, the accessibility of free web host is far from the stander. However, just for a trail, I decided to use the service of <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/"><strong>00webhost</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Then, I tried to post some very simple pages to the web server and succeeded to visit my pages throng the Internet. It is extremely exciting!</p>
