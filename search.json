Now I am a junior majoring in Physics . Physics, I believe, is the logic of the world. But disappointingly, Physics, the art of objects, cares nothing about humanity. So I doubled Economics at year two. Economics reveals the interesting action of human beings both in micro scope and macro scope. However, I never believe that the behavior of people can be modeled with economic theories. As for why I am interested in computer science , the answer is that I am the generation of Internet, which is built by hackers and programmers. I hold the belief that only technology is able to improve the world, although science is the basis of technology. One day, I dream to apply my Physics thinking to computer engineering and then to make the life of human a little bit easier and more interesting.

Additionally, the system had to enable administrators to manage user entities and permissions, and to generate reports on disbursement data. In order to design the database that fulfilled business functionality while minimizing data redundancies, a slew of design methods were adopted. The team began with a Data Flow Diagram of the business process, followed by developing Use Case Narratives with Cross-Functional Flow Charts for the system. These use cases were checked and affirmed by the client representative periodically as well. Data relationships were established by designing an Enhanced ERD Model . Data redundancies were eliminated by normalization through a Relational Model . The team additionally created a **Data Dictionary **to standardize data representations. The finalized client product was developed using PHP and MySQL , and deployed via Wampserver. It is Windows compatible and accessible only through Bethesda CARE’s intranet server. Capacity requirements were minimal, under 100MB of storage required. For details, You can visit the Github repository .

During past couple of days, a newbie, I, who only knew little about the World Wide Web, started to create interesting things based on the web out of curiosity. The feeling of building things is cool, especially something meaningful. I hope from now on, I can learn to become a hacker, devoting myself to solving problems with powerful computational tools, and make the world little bit prettier. Things have done these days 1. Financial Assistance Database System for Living Sanctuary Brethren Church The Financial Assistance Database System (FADS) is a database management software for the course BC2402 Database Management & Business Intelligence . In fact, I did not take this course, while my girlfriend did. Although she majors in computer science and business, programming never eased her. In urgent request of my girlfriend to help her with the project, I had to survive myself from server-side programming, client-side programming and SQL with my not so sufficient knowledge of C/C++ and Matlab. For only one week , I learned HTML , CSS , PHP and MySQL . Isn't it amazing? What really drove me crazy was to install Apache/PHP/MySQL on my own laptop with Windows 8.1. Without a installation wizard, there were huge works to do with the configuration files with considerable variables inside and to type every command in CMD. Here, I would like to share some useful sites which I used for the FADS project. Programming Notes This a substantial note written by Associate Professor Chua Hock Chuan , including How-To, Java , SQL, Server-Side, Client-Side, JavaME, Game, OpenGL, C++ and Android. It is a rarely brief but excellent note for new programmers. W3Schools Perhaps, this is the world' largest web development site. There are professional tutorials and references for HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Server Side, XML and Web Building with plenty of vivid instant examples. You can find everything you need to build a website. Apache/PHP/MySQL For the installation, I searched oceans of documentations, articles, blogs and posts, but failed to find one page that could give step-by-step instructions from the beginning to end. I am able to make it only with references from different source. Maybe when I become a real master one day, I will write a blog about the installation. With the joint effort with Gibson Cheong , we used HTML and CSS to build the front-end interface, and as for the back-end, we used PHP and MySQL . The FADS is a multi-user management system. There are three types of users: super user, administrator and system user, and two kinds of operations, user related operation and financial application (FA) related operation. User related operations include create user, view user, edit user, delete user. Financial application related operation include create FA, search FA, view FA, edit FA, delete FA, generate report, issue disbursement. Different users with different user types have corresponding authorities. Super users have authority to do all the operations. Administrators have authority to do all the financial application related operations. And system users only have authority to create FA and view FA. As for implementation, I did the part of user management and interface design , and Gibson did part of the financial management and compilation. Actually, this is my first time to get involved such a project. To be honest, I was quite enjoying it. There is no doubt I gained practical skills throng the project. 2. Registration of My Own Domain After the last Financial Assistance Database System Project and knowing how to create web page using HTML and CSS, I could not wait to publish something real on the Internet. By researching, I realized that to do this, I had to do the following two steps. Register a domain . Find a host service provider . Setup the web host and upload web pages . For the domain, I desired to register a top level domain related my name, Zhou Ao, but I did not expect to spend on any money on it (How poor a undergraduate student is). So I chose to register a .tk domain in Freenom . The free web host may never be a good choice, only if you just want to try publish something unimportant. For a real site, the accessibility of free web host is far from the stander. However, just for a trail, I decided to use the service of 00webhost . Then, I tried to post some very simple pages to the web server and succeeded to visit my pages throng the Internet. It is extremely exciting! 3. Git and Github Github appeared in my eyesight as I started to be addicted to the popular game 2048. 2048 is a strategy web game developed by Gabriele Cirulli , a Italian young talent, which was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and was released as open-source software on Github . Every soon, the game was developed into dedicated versions for iOS and Android . Initially, I wanted to create an AI to play the game and figure out how many percents the AI can win the game. So, I started to learn JavaScript and design algorithm for the AI. To do this, naturally I came across Github , the Git repository web-based hosting server. Then, I learned about Git , the distributed version control system. And the book, Pro Git , helped me much to understand some difficult concepts. Now, I have created my own Github account , and I am still working on the AI project for 2048 . 4. Github Pages and Jekyll As what you are seeing now, my blog is powered by Github Pages and Jekyll . Github Pages make it very easy to create a website hosted directly from Github repository. By Registration and just a few steps, you can publish you own site. Thanks for the powerful host server of Github, the accessibility is much better than free web host. And Jekyll is a powerful tool to transform plan texts into static websites and blogs. That is to say, by Jekyll, one can maintain a substantial website with little effort. Jekyll is running based on Ruby , so before installation of Jekyll, you should first setup Ruby. Things to Be done 1. Learn Advanced Algorithms. There is one blog (in Chinese) I found interesting about studying Algorithms, 我的算法学习之路 . 2. Learn 18.085 Computational Science and Engineering This course is given by Profess Gilbert Strang , and provides a review of linear algebra, including applications to networks, structures, and estimation, Lagrange multipliers. Also covered are: differential equations of equilibrium; Laplace's equation and potential flow; boundary-value problems; minimum principles and calculus of variations; Fourier series; discrete Fourier transform; convolution; and applications. 3. Learn Econometrics Get prepared for my next semester course. 4. K.O. GRE and IELTS/TOEFL Everyone desiring to go to graduate school knows what does it mean. 5. Work on My 2048 AI Project. Challenging! 6. Design a Website For the Company of My Mother Hope it will help the business of my mother. 7. One week a Blog I believe I can keep my passion. "},{"title":"Binary Search Time Complexity: Average Number of Comparisons","baseurl":"","url":"/blog/Binary%20Search.html","date":"2014-11-25 00:00:00 +0800","categories":["blog"],"body":"Introduction to Binary Search Binary search is a classic and basic search algorithm which is applicable when the array is ordered. This method using the the divide and conquer approach takes advantage of the information of the order of the elements and tries to do less work. Undoubtedly, binary search is very efficient. Java Code Implementation int binarySearch (int [ ] E, int first, int last, int k) { if (last < first return -1; else { int mid = (first + last) / 2; if (k == E[mid]) return mid; else if (k < E[mid]) return binarySearch (E, first, mid − 1, k); else return binarySearch (E, mid + 1, last, k); } } Time Complexity Analysis 1. Worst-case The implementation of binary search is a recursive function, so recursive equation should be established for time complexity analysis. Look back to the code, if we assume the total time of binary search is $T(n)$, for each recursive invocation, the time is $T({n \\over 2})$. So it is not difficult to find the recursive equation. $$T(n)=T({n\\over 2})+c$$ Assume $n=2^k$, $$T(n)=T({n\\over 4})+2c=T({n\\over 8})+3c=...=T({n\\over 2^k})+kc=T(1)+kc$$. Notice that $k=log_2(n)$ and $T(1)=c$, so $T(n)=(k+1)c=(log_2(n)+1)c=O(log(n))$. 2. Average-case Assume $ q $ is the probability that a search is successful and $ n=2^k-1 $. If $A_s(n)$ is the average number of comparisons that a successful search and $A_f(n)$ is the number of comparisons in an unsuccessful search. Then by the law of expectation, $$A_q(n)=qA_s(n)+(1-q)A_f(n).$$ Next, we should calculate $A_s(n)$ and $A_f(n)$ respectively. For $A_f(n)$, we can use the result of the worst-case analysis, because for unsuccessful search we have to conduct the search until last < first .That is to say, the average case for unsuccessful search is $\\lfloor log_2(n) \\rfloor +1=log_2(n+1)$, taking $c=1$. For $As(n)$, the thing is a little bit more complex. We have to find the number of comparisons for every possible case. It is easy to see that if the key is at the position of $n \\over 2$, only 1 comparison is necessary to find the key. Also if the key is at the position of $n\\over4$ or $3n \\over 4$, with 2 comparisons we can find the key. And so on, if the key is located at $(2i-1){n \\over 2^m}$ for $i=1,2...2^{m-1}$, m comparisons are needed. For all the cases, the sum of the elements $1+2+3+...+2^{m-1}$ should be $n$. That is to say, ${1+2+4+...+2^{m-1}}={(1-2^{m})\\over 1-2}=2^{m}-1=n=2^k-1$. So $$m=k.$$ Assume the possibility of all the cases is equal to $1\\over n$, so the average number of comparisons in successful binary search is $$\\sum_{i=1}^{k}{1\\over n}*i*2^{i-1}.$$ By the formula $$\\sum_{i=1}^{k}i*2^{i-1}=2^kk-2^k+1,$$ we can get that $$A_s(n)=log_2(n+1)+{log_2(n+1)\\over n} -1.$$ So after all, $$A_q(n)=q{log_2(n+1) \\over n}-q+log_2(n+1).$$ Through the analysis, we can draw the conclusion that the average case of binary search is $qO({log(n) \\over n})-q+O(log(n)).$ "}]}
