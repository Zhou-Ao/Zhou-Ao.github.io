                Hi, I am Zhou Ao, from Peking University. Great pleasure to see you on my blog site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I am a junior majoring in Physics. Physics, I believe, is the logic of the world. But disappointingly, Physics is the art of objects, caring nothing about humanity. So I doubled Economics at year two. Economics reveals the interesting action of human beings both in a micro scope and macro scope. However, I never believe that the behavior of people can be modeled with numbers and formulas.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for why I am interested in computer science, the answer is that I am the generation of Internet, which is built by hackers and programmers. I hold the belief that only technology is able to improve the world, although science is the basis of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, I dream to apply my Physics thinking to computer engineering and then to make the life of human a little bit easier and more interesting.
