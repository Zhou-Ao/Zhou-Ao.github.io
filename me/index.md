Hi, I am **Zhou Ao**, from **Peking University**. Great pleasure to see you on my blog site.

Now I am a junior majoring in **Physics**. Physics, I believe, is the logic of the world. But disappointingly, Physics, the art of objects, cares nothing about humanity. So I doubled **Economics** at year two. Economics reveals the interesting action of human beings both in micro scope and macro scope. However, I never believe that the behavior of people can be modeled with economic theories.

As for why I am interested in **computer science**, the answer is that I am the generation of Internet, which is built by hackers and programmers. I hold the belief that only technology is able to improve the world, although science is the basis of technology.

One day, I dream to **apply my Physics thinking to computer engineering** and then to make the life of human a little bit easier and more interesting.
