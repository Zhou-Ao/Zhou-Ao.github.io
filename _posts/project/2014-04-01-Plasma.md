title: Numerical Simulation of Plasma Turbulence in Edge Region with Magnetic Bound  
description: The project simulates the nonlinear plasma turbulent transport in edge region. In the physical model, the impact of ion temperature on the potential of plasma is considered to precisely simulate the nonlinear development and spacial structure of plasma potential.
